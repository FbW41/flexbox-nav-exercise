#### Flexbox Navigation

1. Create an html page that has nav and main elements.

2. Create a desktop version of the Nav as shown in the reference image.

3. Create a media query so that at 575px or below the nav turns into a column as shown in the reference image.

- Try to style it as shown in the images as well although the focus is on using flexbox.
